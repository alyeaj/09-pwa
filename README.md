### Process
This link doesn't work:

But I can install it on my laptop but only on local host for now:

I have been having some issues with deploying the droplet on digital ocean. The status doesn't detect any errors yet the link won't work. I don't know if it's because the app is attached to the local host link or if it's because I'm using the same droplet I was using for assignment 7 which didn't have the saved changes I made from forking the the repo. Though I did notice that in the pm2 status for this assignment, it says its mode is forked. I'm unsure of what I did but at least I can install the game on my laptop. Though even with local host on, it wouldn't work on my phone.
